All of the cations currently used in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) abide by the tolerance factor for incorporation into the lattice. We show that the small and oxidation- stable  $\mathsf{Rb^{+}}$  can be embedded into a "cation cascade" to create perovskite materials with excellent material properties. We achieved stabilized efficiencies of up to  $21.6\%$  (average value:  $20.2\%$  ) on small areas (and a stabilized  $19.0\%$  on a  $0.5cm^2$  cell) as well as an electroluminescence of  $3.8\%$ . The open- circuit voltage of 1.24 volts at a band gap of 1.63 electron volts leads to loss- in- potential of  $0.39V$ , versus  $0.4V$  for commercial silicon cells. Polymer- coated cells maintained  $95\%$  of their initial performance at  $85^{\circ}C$  for 500 hours under full solar illumination and maximum power point tracking.

Low- cost perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of  $22.1\%$  (I). The organic- inorganic perovskites used for photovoltaics (PV) have an  $\mathrm{AMX_3}$  formula that is comprised of a monovalent cation,  $\mathrm{A} =$  [cesium  $\mathrm{Cs^{+}}$ ; methylammonium (MA)  $\mathrm{CH_3NH_3^+}$ ; formamidinium (FA)  $\mathrm{CH_2(NH_2)_2^+}$ ]; a divalent metal  $\mathrm{M} =$ $(\mathrm{Pb^{2 + }}$ ,  $\mathrm{Sn^{2 + }}$ ; and an anion  $\mathrm{X} = (\mathrm{Cl^- }, \mathrm{Br^- }, \mathrm{I^- })$ . The highest efficiency perovskites are  $\mathrm{Pb}$ - based with mixed  $\mathrm{MA / FA}$  cations and  $\mathrm{Br / I}$  halides (2- 4). Recently,  $\mathrm{Cs}$  was used to explore more complex cation combinations, i.e.,  $\mathrm{Cs / MA}$ ,  $\mathrm{Cs / FA}$  and  $\mathrm{Cs / MA / FA}$  (5- 9). These perovskite formulations exhibit unexpected properties. For example,  $\mathrm{Cs / FA}$  mixtures suppress halide segregation enabling band gaps for perovskite/silicon tandems (10). The  $\mathrm{Cs / MA / FA}$  based solar cells are more reproducible and thermally stable than  $\mathrm{MA / FA}$  mixtures (9).

In general, increasing the perovskite complexity is motivated by the need to improve stability by adding more inorganic elements and increasing the entropy of mixing, which can stabilize ordinarily unstable materials (such as the "yellow," non- photoactive phase of  $\mathrm{FAPbI_3}$  that can be avoided using small amounts of the otherwise unstable  $\mathrm{CsPbI_3}$  (6, 7). However, all combinations of  $\mathrm{Cs}$ ,  $\mathrm{MA}$ , and  $\mathrm{FA}$  cations were selected because each individually forms a photoactive perovskite "black" phase (11- 13).

In order to progress further, a wider circle of cations need to be explored. However, most monovalent cations are mismatched to sustain a photoactive  $\mathrm{APbI_3}$  perovskite with an appropriate Goldschmidt tolerance factor  $[t = r_{\mathrm{A}} + r_{\mathrm{I}} / \sqrt{2} (r_{\mathrm{Pb}} + r_{\mathrm{I}}); r$  are the respective ionic radii] between 0.8 and 1.0 (14) rendering almost all elemental cations too small for consideration. We illustrate this point in Fig. 1A where we conduct tolerance factor calculations for the alkali metals (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs); and MA, FA (see table S1 for the numeric values and ionic radii). We selected specifically the alkali metals which are oxidation- stable monovalent cations, as these would have a stability advantage over oxidation- prone  $\mathrm{Pb / Sn}$  mixtures that have distorted material electronic properties (15).

The tolerance factor shows that only  $\mathrm{CsPbI_3}$  (as well as  $\mathrm{MAPbI_3}$  and  $\mathrm{FAPbI_3}$ ) fall into the range of "established perovskites" with a black phase. However, while  $\mathrm{Li}$ ,  $\mathrm{Na}$  and  $\mathrm{K}$  are clearly outside of the range,  $\mathrm{RbPbI_3}$  only misses by a small margin. The ionic radius of  $\mathrm{Cs}$  and  $\mathrm{Rb}$  is  $167~\mathrm{pm}$  and  $152~\mathrm{p.m.}$ , respectively. This small difference still has a large impact, with  $\mathrm{RbPbI_3}$  and  $\mathrm{CsPbI_3}$  drawing the demarcation line between photoactive black perovskite and photoinactive yellow non- perovskite phases. In Fig. 1B, we demonstrate this by heating  $\mathrm{CsPbI_3}$  and  $\mathrm{RbPbI_3}$  films at different temperatures. Both films are yellow at  $28^{\circ}C$ . Upon heating to  $380^{\circ}C$ , only  $\mathrm{CsPbI_3}$  turns black whereas  $\mathrm{RbPbI_3}$  remains yellow. Finally, at  $460^{\circ}C$  both films start melting irreversibly without  $\mathrm{RbPbI_3}$  ever showing a black phase which is consistent with the observations by Trots and co- workers (16).

Thus, only  $\mathrm{CsPbI_3}$  has a black phase explaining why Rb, despite its desirable oxidation stability, has so far not been used for PSCs.

In this work, we propose embedding  $\mathrm{Rb^{+}}$  only slightly smaller than  $\mathrm{Cs^{+}}$  , into a photoactive perovskite phase using multiple A- cation formulations. We retain FA as the majority cation because of the beneficial, red- shifted band gap. We identify four previously unexplored combinations: RbFA; RbCsFA, RbMAFA; and RbCsMAFA. In (17) and figs. S1 to S3, following the antisolvent approach pioneered by Jeon et al. (2), we present device data on a glass/fluorine- doped tin oxide/compact  $\mathrm{TiO_2}$  mesoporous  $\mathrm{TiO_2}$  /perovskite/spiroOMeTAD/Au architecture [see fig. S4A for a cross sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image and fig. S4C for an image of typical devices]. All preparation details are given in (17). We use the homenclature of RbFA, RbCsFA, RbMAFA, and RbCsMAFA to denote the entire perovskite compounds at the optimized values found in (17) (usually achieved with an addition of 5 to  $10\%$  Rb).

Reasonable device performances were reached with RbFA  $(14\%)$  RbCsFA  $(19.3\%)$  RbMAFA  $(19.2\%)$  comparable to CsFA  $(20\%)$  CsMAFA  $(19.2\%)$  as shown in figs. S1 to S3 (measured on a device area of  $0.16~\mathrm{cm^2}$  .Thus, Rb can stabilize the black phase of FA perovskite and be integrated into PSCs, despite not being suitable as a pure  $\mathrm{RbPbI_3}$  compound. Surprisingly, RbCsMAFA (with  $5\%$  of Rb, fig. S3) results in PCEs of  $20.6\%$  [with an open- circuit voltage  $(\mathrm{V_{oc}})$  of  $1186\mathrm{mV}]$  17).Hence, we focus below on RbCsMAFA in order to substantiate the impact of  $\mathrm{Rb^{+}}$  integration approach for PSCs.

We investigated the starting condition of the crystallization process for the RbCsMAFA compound upon annealing at  $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  which is needed to fully crystallize the perovskite films. In Fig. 2A, we present the ultraviolet- visible (UV- vis) and photoluminescence (PL) data of the unannealed MAFA and RbCsMAFA films. Whereas MAFA showed several PL peaks with maxima ranging from 670 to  $790~\mathrm{nm}$  the RbCsMAFA film had a narrow peak at  $770 \mathrm{nm}$  attributable to perovskite. The insets are fluorescence microscopy maps of the surface of the unannealed films showing that the MAFA films are comprised of various emissive species forcing the pre- annealed film to crystallize with inhomogeneous starting conditions. However, the RbCsMAFA films were emissive in a narrow range and begin to crystallize from more homogeneous conditions. Thus, the addition of the inorganic cations enforced a crystallization that starts with a photoactive perovskite phase (near the final emission after annealing) instead of a mixture of varying emissions that need to converge toward the final emission (see Fig. 2C). These results are consistent with the high reproducibility and lack of yellow phase in the RbCsMAFA films.

Furthermore, we collected the corresponding  $\mathbf{x}$  - ray dif fraction (XRD) data of the unannealed films (Fig. 2B) that showed a pronounced perovskite peak for RbCsMAFA as compared to MAFA films. In Fig. 2, C and D, we show analogous data after annealing including UV- vis, PL and XRD data revealing a RbCsMAFA band gap of  $\sim 1.63\mathrm{eV}$  (slightly blue shifted compared to MAFA at  $\sim 1.62\mathrm{eV}$  ) containing neither a  $\mathrm{PbI_2}$  nor a yellow  $\delta$  - phase peak. The low- angle perovskite peak for MAFA and RbCsMAFA occurs at  $14.17^{\circ}$  and  $14.25^{\circ}$  respectively, revealing that Rb indeed modified the crystal lattice. In figs. S5 and S6, we show XRD data of RbMAFA perovskite where we increased the concentration of Rb. We observed, similar to CsMAFA (9), that the lead excess and the yellow- phase impurities of MAFA perovskite disappeared when Rb was added. For  $\mathrm{Rb_5MAFA}$  there was a shift to wider angles for the perovskite peak. Moreover, in figs. S7 and S8, we show a series of RbCsMAFA perovskite with an increased amount of Rb together with a  $\mathrm{RbPbI_3}$  reference. We observed that the perovskite peak shifted to wider angles for  $\mathrm{Rb_5CsMAFA}$  as well as further suppression of the residual  $\mathrm{PbI_2}$ $(12.7^{\circ})$  and yellow- phase peak  $(11.7^{\circ})$  of FA- perovskite. Interestingly, as more Rb was added, we noted the appearance of a second peak at  $13.4^{\circ}$  and a double peak at  $10.1^{\circ}$  which coincide with the peaks for the pure yellow- phase  $\mathrm{RbPbI_3}$  indicating phase segregation at higher Rb concentrations. This is in good agreement with previous work where a phase segregation was also observed as more and more Cs was added to FA- based perovskite (8).

In addition, the top- view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images reveal large crystals in the RbCsMAFA devices (see fig. S9), which has been shown to be beneficial for the PV metrics (18). We also show energy- dispersive X- ray spectroscopy measurements in fig. S10 indicating the presence and distribution of Cs and Rb within the perovskite layer.

We collected statistical data on RbCsMAFA devices (with 12 CsMAFA and 17 RbCsMAFA devices measured with a scan rate of  $10\mathrm{mV s^{- 1}}$  without preconditioning, such as light soaking or long- term forward voltage biasing; see fig. S11) and observed superior performance compared to CsMAFA. Remarkably, the average open- circuit voltage  $(\mathrm{V_{oc}})$  is increased from 1120 to  $1158~\mathrm{mV}$  and the fill factor from 0.75 to 0.78. In Fig. 3A, we show the RbCsMAFA champion cell reached a stabilized power output of  $21.6\%$  with a fill factor of  $81\%$  and  $1180\mathrm{mV}$  open- circuit voltage. The measured  $\mathbf{J}_{\mathrm{sc}}$  matched the incident- photon- to- current- efficiency (IPCE) measurement in fig. S12. We also achieved a stabilized PCE of  $19.0\%$  on a large- area  $0.5\mathrm{cm}^2$  device (see fig. S13).

To correctly determine the  $\mathrm{V_{oc}}$  we investigated RbCsMAFA devices with the active area being fully illuminated, held at room temperature, and under an inert nitrogen atmosphere. This setup permitted an accurate  $\mathrm{V_{oc}}$  value without heating or degradation effects (from moisture for

example). In Fig. 3B, for one of our highest performing devices, we measured an outstanding  $\mathrm{V_{oc}}$  of  $1240\mathrm{mV}$  confirmed by the inset that is tracking the  $\mathrm{V_{oc}}$  over time. The "loss- in- potential" (difference between  $\mathrm{V_{oc}}$  and band gap) is only  $\sim 0.39\mathrm{V}$ , which is one of the lowest recorded for any PV material, implying very small non- radiation recombination losses (19). The high  $\mathrm{V_{oc}}$  is particularly intriguing because this is the major parameter preventing PSCs from reaching their thermodynamic limit ( $\mathrm{J_{sc}}$  and FF are already approaching their maximal values). Theoretically, in very pure, defect- free materials with only radiative recombination, the loss- in- potential can be as small as 0.23 (band gap of  $1\mathrm{eV}$ ) to  $0.3\mathrm{V}$  (band gap of  $2\mathrm{eV}$ ). In particular, silicon, the main industrial PV material, cannot approach this limit because of its indirect band gap and Auger recombination exhibiting a loss- in- potential of  $\sim 0.4\mathrm{V}$  for the most efficient devices (19).

The non- radiative recombination losses were quantified by measuring the external electroluminescence quantum efficiency  $(\mathrm{EQE_{EL}})$ , which is  $>1\%$  at a driving current that is equal to the short circuit current (see Fig. 3C). This value is in the same order of magnitude and thus consistent with a measured external PL quantum yield of  $3.6\%$  for RbCsMAFA (and  $2.4\%$  for CsMAFA). Following the approach in (20- 24) [see also fig. S14 and (17)], we used the  $\mathrm{EQE_{EL}}$  and the emission spectrum to predict a  $\mathrm{V_{oc}}$  of  $1240\mathrm{mV}$  confirming independently the value measured from the JV curve.

Furthermore, for higher driving currents, the  $\mathrm{EQE_{EL}}$  in Fig. 3C reaches  $3.8\%$ , making the solar cell one of the most efficient perovskite LEDs as well, emitting in the near IR/red spectral range (see inset image) (25- 27). We also present a video in the SM showing a RbCsMAFA device mounted in our custom- made device holder. As we tuned toward maximum emission and back, we observed bright EL in day light. For comparison, for commercially available Si solar cells,  $\mathrm{EQE_{EL}} \approx 0.5\%$  (19). These values for our PSC devices indicate that all major sources of non- radiative recombination were strongly suppressed and the material has very low bulk and surface defect density. We also investigate transport behavior using intensity- modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) suggesting that the charge transport within the RbCsMAFA perovskite layer is substantially faster than in CsMAFA which is already much more defect- free compared to MAFA (18) [see also fig. S15 and (17)].

Despite the high efficiencies and an outstanding EL, this Rb- containing perovskite material must be able to achieve high stability. This task is not trivial given the hygroscopic nature of perovskite films, phase instabilities and light sensitivity (28). Interestingly, the Achilles' heel of PSCs is not necessarily the perovskite itself but rather the commonly used  $2,2^{\prime},7,7^{\prime}$  - tetrakis(N,N- di- p- methoxyphenylamine)- 9,9'- spirobifluorene (spiro- OMeTAD) hole transporter material

HTM) that becomes permeable (at elevated temperature) to metal electrode diffusion into the perovskite causing irreversible degradation (29, 30). This effect can be mitigated with buffer layers or by avoiding the usage of metal electrodes (29- 31). Alternatively, for the combined heat- light stress tests in this work, we find a thin layer of PTAA (see SEM image in fig. S4B) to work equally well (32). We imposed the above protocols simultaneously and aged devices for 500 hours at  $85^{\circ}C$  under continuous illumination with full solar intensity and maximum power point tracking in a nitrogen atmosphere. This compounded stress test exceeds industrial standards (33). We show the result in Fig. 3D (red curve, circles). The device started with  $>17\%$  efficiency at room temperature before the aging protocol was applied (see fig. S16 for a non- normalized PCE, FF,  $\mathrm{J_{sc}}$ ,  $\mathrm{V_{oc}}$ ,  $\mathrm{J_{MPP}}$  and  $\mathrm{V_{MPP}}$ ). During the  $85^{\circ}C$  step (in which the  $\mathrm{V_{oc}}$  is inevitably lowered), the device retained  $95\%$  of its initial performance.

Fig. 1. Tolerance factor and perovskites at different temperatures. (A) Tolerance factor of  $\mathsf{APbI}_3$  perovskite with the oxidation-stable  $\mathsf{A} = \mathsf{Li}$ , Na, K, Rb, Cs; and MA, FA (see table S1 for detailed calculations and ionic radii). Empirically, perovskites with a tolerance factor between 0.8 and 1.0 (dashed lines) show a photoactive black phase (solid circles) as opposed to non-photoactive phases (open circles). Rb (red open circle) is very close to this limit making it a candidate for integration into the perovskite lattice. (B) (a-c)  $\mathsf{CsPbI}_3$  (d-f)  $\mathsf{RbPbI}_3$  at  $28^{\circ}C$  (a, d),  $380^{\circ}C$  (b, e),  $460^{\circ}C$  (c, f). Irreversible melting for both compounds occurs at  $460^{\circ}C$ .  $\mathsf{RbPbI}_3$  never shows a black phase.

Fig. 2. Characterization of unannealed and annealed films. (A) UV-vis (dashed lines) and photoluminescence (solid lines) of unannealed MAFA (black) and RbCsMAFA (red) films. The inset images show fluorescence microscopy measurements (image size  $\sim 26 \times 26 \mu m^2$ ) of MAFA (left) and RbCsMAFA (right image) films. The image is an overlay of three emission ranges sampled from 640 - 650 nm, assigned as green; from 680 - 690 nm (blue); and 725 - 735 nm (red). The colors were chosen to ensure easily discernible features. (B) XRD data of the unannealed MAFA and RbCsMAFA films. (C) UV-vis (dashed) and photoluminescence (solid lines) of annealed (at  $100^{\circ}C$  for 1 hour) MAFA (black) and RbCsMAFA (red) films. (D) XRD data of the annealed MAFA and RbCsMAFA films. The  $\mathsf{PbI}_2$  and yellow phase peak is denoted as # and  $\delta$ , respectively.

Fig. 3. Champion efficiency, open-circuit voltage, electroluminescence and high temperature stability. (A) Current-density/voltage (JV) curve, taken at  $10 \text{mV s}^{-1}$  scan rate, of the best performing solar cell at  $21.8\%$  efficiency  $(V_{oc} = 1180 \text{mV}, J_{sc} = 22.8 \text{mA cm}^{-2}$ , and a fill factor of  $81\%$ ). The forward and reverse scan is shown in table S2. The inset shows the scan rate independent maximum power point (MPP) tracking for  $60 \text{s}$  resulting in a stabilized efficiency of  $21.6\%$  at  $977 \text{mV}$  and  $22.1 \text{mA cm}^{-2}$  (displayed as the red triangles in the JV and MPP scan, respectively). (B) JV curve of the highest open-circuit voltage device. The inset shows the  $V_{oc}$  over  $120 \text{s}$  resulting in  $1240 \text{mV}$  (displayed as the red triangles in the JV and  $V_{oc}$  scan, respectively). (C) EQE electroluminescence (EL) as a function of voltage. The left inset shows the corresponding EL spectrum over wavelength. The image in the inset is a solar cell with 2 active areas. The left area is operated as an LED displaying a clearly visible red emission even under ambient light. At the same time, the right area can be operated as a solar cell or a photodetector underlining the versatility of the perovskite material. (D) Thermal stability test of a perovskite solar cell. The device is aged for 500 hours at  $85^{\circ}\text{C}$  under continuous full sun illumination and maximum power point tracking in a nitrogen atmosphere (red curve, circles). This aging routine exceeds industry norms. During the full sun light soaking at  $85^{\circ}\text{C}$ , the device retains  $95\%$  (dashed line) of its initial performance.
