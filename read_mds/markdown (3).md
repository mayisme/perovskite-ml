ABSTRACT: Commercial  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystals used for producing electron transporting layers (ETLs) of perovskite solar cells (PSC) are prone to aggregation at room temperature and contain many structural defects. Herein, we report that the LiOH additive can simultaneously delay the aggregation and donate the beneficial aging effect to  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystals. The resulting  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  ETLs show the desired characteristics, including a broadened absorption range, reduced defects, improved transporting properties, and decreased work function. Meanwhile, perovskite  $\mathrm{Cs_{0.15}FA_{0.65}MA_{0.20}Pb(I_{0.80}Br_{0.20})_3}$  films with a wide bandgap of  $1.68~\mathrm{eV}$  grown on them exhibit the pure phase, higher crystalinity, fewer defects, better buried- interface contact, and more aligned energy levels with each other than the ones based on  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystals without the LiOH additive and aging treatment. Hence, the average efficiencies are boosted from  $(18.79\pm 0.40)\%$  to (20.16  $\pm 0.36)\%$  for the resulting wide- bandgap PSCs, wherein the champion efficiency of  $21.12\%$  is achieved. In addition, the as- obtained PSCs possess good thermal and humidity stability.

# 1. INTRODUCTION

Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have developed as one of the most promising photovoltaic technologies over the past decade, for which the certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been boosted up to  $26.7\%$  benefiting from the outstanding optoelectronic characteristics of metal halide perovskite materials as well as the great research efforts focused on functional materials and interface engineering. In spite of the PCE improvement slowing down in the last two years, there is still a certain room for further progress to make PSCs market ready. Currently, strategies for solving device reliability issues and recipes for reliable, low- cost, scalable device production have become the focus topics in this field.

In terms of a planar in- i- p PSC, the perovskite layer is sandwiched between an electron transporting layer (ETL) and a hole transporting layer (HTL). In this case, the efficient extraction and transportation of photoinduced electrons at the perovskite/ETL interface and of photogenerated holes at the perovskite/HTL interface are critical to achieving a highperformance PSC. Moreover, the p- type feature of most perovskite films makes the n- type ETLs extremely vital, wherein several basic criteria are required, including good energy level alignment, high carrier mobility, low parasitic absorption, and ease of manufacturing. Meanwhile, the morphology and surface wettability properties of the ETLs should also be well- controlled to reduce the defects at the perovskite/ETL interface.

$\mathrm{SnO}_2$  materials have been widely used as ETLs of PSCs, in view of their combined characteristics, including suitable band energy levels, superior optical transparency, high electron mobility, and excellent chemical/ultraviolet light stability. Indeed, the best- recorded PCE of PSCs is achieved by devices with  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  ETLs. Till now, most of the  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  ETLs are prepared through spin- coating the commercial  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystal solution onto ITO/FTO substrates, followed by proper thermal annealing. However,  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystals seem to be unstable in colloidal solution and tend to form large agglomerates derived from van der Waals interactions. These agglomerations would make the surface of  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  ETLs nonuniform and pinhole- inclusive, thereby degrading the performance of the final PSCs. Moreover, numerous trap defects generated from hydroxyl groups  $(- \mathrm{OH})$ , tin interstitials  $(\mathrm{Sn}_i)$ , and oxygen vacancies  $(\mathrm{V}_o)$  may stay naturally on the surface of  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystals during solution processing. Such defects act as trigger points for charge accumulation and carrier recombination at the  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$ /perovskite interface, inducing decreased PCEs and a serious

hysteresis phenomenon of related PSCs. In addition, the energy level alignment between the  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  ETL and the perovskite absorber does not match well, and large energy losses and open- circuit voltage  $(V_{\mathrm{oc}})$  deficits still exist in the state- of- the- art PSCs.21,22

In this case, great efforts have been devoted to addressing the obstacles faced by  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystals for ETL applications.13,23 On the one hand, some strategies have been developed to ameliorate the trap defects of  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  ETLs. For instance, Jung et al.24 modified the  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  surface using KF and  $\mathrm{NH_4F}$ , wherein the reduced surface hydroxyl oxygen, accelerated carrier transport, and suppressed interfacial nonradiative were demonstrated. Hoang et al.25 reported  $\mathrm{Li^{+} / Ni^{+}}$  doped  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  with elevated Fermi energy levels and increased electrical conductivity. Guo et al.26 added formamidine oxalate (FOA) into the  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  solution, enabling the suppression of surficial  $V_{\mathrm{o}}s$  and improved carrier transport rates at the  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  ETL/perovskite interface. Lim et al.27 used Cs dopants to modify the  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  ETLs, and they found that  $\mathrm{Cs}^+$  content triggers improved quality and reduced defect states of perovskite films. Wang et al.25 investigated the modification effects of alkali fluoride salts (KF, RbF, and CsF) on the properties of  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  ETLs and the performance of corresponding PSCs. On the other hand, some works have focused on inhibiting the aggregation of  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystals in the colloidal solution. For example, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG),28 poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA),29 streptomycin sulfate (STRS) molecules,30 etc., have been attempted to be introduced into the colloidal solution of  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystals, leading to enhanced dispersibility of the nanocrystals. Seok et al.31 demonstrated the preparation of  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  colloids in the  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2$  solution, yielding  $4 - 6\mathrm{nm}$  particles with reduced  $V_{\mathrm{o}}s$  and homogeneous dispersibility. Bu et al.17 demonstrated the synthesis of high- quality  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystals at low temperature by introducing small molecules of glycerol, obtaining a stable and well- dispersed  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystal isopropanol dispersion. Li et al.32 achieved the reassembly of  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanoparticles into smaller sizes with more homogeneous dispersion and dense interconnections by controlling the  $\mathrm{pH}$  value of the  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystal solution with carbonic acid. Jung et al.33 modulated the  $\mathrm{pH}$  of  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanoparticles colloidal dispersion by  $\mathrm{HNO}_3$ , leading to the removal of  $- \mathrm{OH}$  species on the  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  surface as well as the superb regularity of the thin films by generating a network of  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanoparticles. Even though the above studies achieved meaningful success to overcome the obstacles faced by  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystals from different aspects, the strategies to simultaneously inhibit agglomeration and optimize the electrical properties of  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystals in facile manners are rarely reported. The task of homogeneous and high- quality  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  ETLs still remains.

In this study, we propose to use  $\mathrm{LiOH}$  as an additive for the  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystal solution, aiming to prepare desired  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  ETLs. It is found that the  $\mathrm{LiOH}$  additive can not only suppress agglomeration but also trigger a beneficial aging effect for  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystals. The  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  ETLs based on the aged  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystal solution with the  $\mathrm{LiOH}$  additive exhibit a broadened absorption range, fewer defects, better transport properties, and a smaller work function. In this manner,

simultaneous agglomeration inhibition and electrical properties optimization are achieved successfully. Moreover, the  $1.68\mathrm{eV}$  bandgap perovskite  $\mathrm{Cs_{0.15}FA_{0.65}MA_{0.20}Pb(I_{0.80}Br_{0.20})_3}$  films grown on them possess a pure phase, higher crystallinity, fewer defects, better buried- interface contact, and more aligned energy levels with each other. As a result, the average PCEs are boosted to  $(20.16\pm 0.36)\%$  for PSCs fabricated with the aged  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystal solution with the LiOH additive from (18.79  $\pm 0.40)\%$  for ones based on fresh  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystal solution without LiOH. And, the best- performing PSC yields an impressive PCE of  $21.12\%$  coupled with superior thermal and humidity stability.

# 2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Commercial  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystal solution (  $15\%$  in  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  colloidal dispersion) was first diluted by deionized water at a volume ratio of 1:4. Then,  $2\mathrm{mg / mL}$  of LiOH additive was added to it with continuous magnetic stirring. After that, the solution underwent aging treatment for 30 days by being kept at  $26^{\circ}C$  in a dark condition, which was named as  $\mathrm{^iLiOH + }$  aging.A similar diluted  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystal solution, without the LiOH additive and aging treatment, with the LiOH additive but without aging treatment, and without the LiOH additive but with aging treatment were also prepared with the labels "pristine",  $\mathrm{^iLiOH^{\prime\prime}}$  and "pristine  $^+$  aging", respectively. Finally, the  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films with a typical thickness of  $\sim 35 \mathrm{nm}$  were obtained by spin- coating the  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystal solution onto precleaned ITO glass substrates, with further thermal annealing at  $180^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  for  $15\mathrm{min}$  33

Figure 1a gives photographs of different  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystal solution samples. One can see that the fresh solution is quite clear, regardless of the LiOH additive, indicating the good dispersibility of the fresh nanocrystals. After aging treatment, the nanocrystal solution without the LiOH additive becomes slightly turbid, suggesting the spontaneous aggregation of  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystals due to the van der Waals forces between the nanoparticles to reduce the surface free energy.18- 20 This phenomenon has been frequently observed earlier,13,15,17 and it can cause serious nonuniformity in the final  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films. In comparison, the  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystal solution with the LiOH additive seemed to undergo marginal aggregation over 30 days. We further extended the time scale of storage stability to over 100 days. As shown in Figure S1, the aggregation of nanocrystal solutions without the LiOH additive becomes more serious. These observations manifest that the LiOH additive can stabilize the nanocrystals effectively. The dynamic light scattering (DLS) results in Figure 1b indicates similar facts. To be specific, the fresh  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystal solution, no matter with or without the LiOH additive, shows a monodisperse distribution of particle sizes with average values of  $\sim 5.75$  and  $\sim 5.24 \mathrm{nm}$  respectively. After the aging treatment, the one without the LiOH additive exhibits a much- broadened size distribution because of the formation of clusters over  $80 \mathrm{nm}$  in size. In contrast, the  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystal solution with the LiOH additive yields similar size distribution characteristics to the fresh ones, apart from the slightly larger average size of  $\sim 8.61 \mathrm{nm}$ . Since the aggregation of the  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystal solution without the LiOH additive but with aging treatment is serious, it is thus excluded from the investigations below.

It is generally accepted that  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystals in aqueous dispersion show an acidic feature dominated by the chemical equilibrium equation:  $\mathrm{Sn - OH + OH^{- }\leftrightarrow Sn - O^{- } + }$

$\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$ .19,32,33 In this case, the nanocrystals are surrounded by relatively numerous  $\mathrm{O}^{- }$  species on the surface. The negative charges on the surface induce a Coulombic repulsion between  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystals, enabling them to be dispersed individually. However, owing to the large specific surface area of  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystals and van der Waals forces within them, aggregation happens inevitably, as illustrated in the top panel of Figure 1c. Once a strong alkali,  $\mathrm{LiOH}$ , is added to the dispersion, the equilibrium will move toward the right side to compensate for the increased basic components  $\mathrm{OH}^{- }$ ; then,  $\mathrm{OH}^{- }$  species on the nanocrystal surface will increase. The enriched  $\mathrm{OH}^{- }$  species lead to reinforced repulsion, thereby inhibiting the nanocrystals to approach each other closer,15,32,33 as schematically shown in the bottom panel of Figure 1c. Figure 1d- f provides the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of pristine,  $\mathrm{LiOH}$ , and  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging samples, wherein the average particle sizes of  $(5.33\pm 0.49)$ ,  $(6.24\pm 0.67)$ , and  $(9.27\pm 0.67)$  nm can be identified for them (Figure S2), in line with the DLS measurement results. Figure S3 reveals a well- crystallized phase of the (110) lattice plane with a  $d$ - spacing of  $0.33 \mathrm{nm}$  of the tetragonal crystal structure for all the samples.22,31 That is to say, both the  $\mathrm{LiOH}$  additive and the aging treatment have marginal influences on the crystalline properties of  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystals.

The various  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films produced with pristine,  $\mathrm{LiOH}$ , and  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystal precursors are further characterized. For simplicity, the  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films are named as those of the corresponding nanocrystal precursors. Ultraviolet- visible (UV- vis) absorption spectra in Figure 1g show that the pristine  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  film has excellent light transmittance from the UV to visible regions, with an absorption onset of 328 nm and a bandgap of  $\sim 3.78 \mathrm{eV}$ , which is beneficial to reduce parasitic absorption.12,13 The consistent blue- shift of the absorption onset to  $324 \mathrm{nm}$  can be found for the  $\mathrm{LiOH}$  and  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films, indicating a widened bandgap of  $\sim 3.82 \mathrm{eV}$ . Such a phenomenon is largely related to the doping of  $\mathrm{Li}^{+}$  cations from the  $\mathrm{LiOH}$  additive into  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystals, derived by thermal annealing during film preparation.34,35 Figure S4 gives the UV- vis absorption spectra of the three types of  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films before annealing, wherein nearly identical absorption characteristics can be seen. The widened bandgap of the related  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films induced by  $\mathrm{Li}^{+}$  doping may be associated with the upward shift of the Fermi energy due to the increasing carrier concentration and electronic modification of the band edges introduced by the addition of  $\mathrm{Li}^{+}$  cations, largely as substitutional lithium  $(\mathrm{Li}_{\mathrm{Sn}})$  involved in  $\mathrm{Li}_{\mathrm{Sn} - \mathrm{O}}$  bonds.34,36 In fact, the  $\mathrm{Li}^{+}$  doping strategy, and even modifications with other similar metal hydroxides, such as  $\mathrm{KOH}$ ,  $\mathrm{NaOH}$ , and  $\mathrm{Mg(OH)}_2$ , have been explored for  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$ - based PSCs,37,38 while the bandgap variation phenomenon was rarely observed for the corresponding  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  ETLs.39 In this case, the study of the  $\mathrm{LiOH}$  and  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films as ETLs of PSCs is of great significance.

Raman measurements were further performed on the as- concerned  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films to study their crystalline structure. As presented in Figure 1h, all the films yield similar Raman peaks at 552 and  $625 \mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ , being assigned to vibrational modes of  $\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{g}}$  and  $\mathrm{A}_{1\mathrm{g}}$ , respectively.40 The  $\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{g}}$  mode has been identified to arise from in- plane  $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{o}}\mathrm{s}$ , while the  $\mathrm{A}_{1\mathrm{g}}$  is related to the small size effect according to the Matossi force constant model.40 We can see that the  $\mathrm{LiOH}$  additive seems to induce more  $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{o}}\mathrm{s}$  in the final  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  film, while the aging treatment can eliminate this effect thoroughly. Meanwhile, the conductivities of various

$\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films were studied by measuring the current- voltage  $\left(I - V\right)$  curves upon the electron- only devices with the configuration of  $\mathrm{Ag / SnO_2 / Ag}$ , with the results presented in Figure 1i. The conductivity can be calculated using the equation  $\sigma = Id / VA,^{41}$  wherein  $\sigma$  represents the conductivity of the  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  film,  $d$  is the space between the two  $\mathrm{Ag}$  electrodes  $(2\mathrm{mm})$ ,  $A$  is the area of the  $\mathrm{Ag}$  electrode, and  $V$  and  $I$  stand for the applied voltage and measured current, respectively. Thus, we can obtain the  $\sigma$  values of  $2.49\times 10^{- 3}$ ,  $2.85\times 10^{- 3}$ , and  $4.51\times 10^{- 3}\mathrm{mScm}^{- 1}$  for pristine,  $\mathrm{LiOH}_i$  and  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films, respectively. Clearly, the  $\mathrm{LiOH}$  additive can help to improve the conductivity of the  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  film owing to the doping effect of  $\mathrm{Li^{+}}$  cations. More importantly, the aging treatment can strengthen this effect significantly. The improved conductivity is generally expected to boost electron transportation and inhibit interfacial carrier accumulation in the final PSC.

X- ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) tests were carried out to probe the Sn, O, and Li elements in order to ascertain the impact of the  $\mathrm{LiOH}$  additive and aging treatment on the compositional elements and their chemical valence states. As indicated by Figure 2a, the  $\mathrm{Sn}3\mathrm{d}_{5 / 2}$  and  $\mathrm{Sn}3\mathrm{d}_{3 / 2}$  XPS peaks are located at 487.41 and  $495.82\mathrm{eV}$  for the pristine  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  film, with an energy difference of around  $8.41\mathrm{eV}$ , corresponding to the charge state of  $\mathrm{Sn^{4 + }}$  in rutile- type  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$ . By comparison, the peaks shift toward higher binding energy by  $0.17\mathrm{eV}$  for  $\mathrm{LiOH}$  and  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films, which manifest again that the  $\mathrm{Li^{+}}$  cations were successfully incorporated into the crystal lattice of  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films. Figure 2b

gives the corresponding core- level O 1s XPS spectra. All of the O 1s peaks can be decoupled into two characteristic peaks situated at 531.5 and  $530.4\mathrm{eV}$ , respectively. The peaks with high binding energy (HBE) are related to surficial  $- \mathrm{OH}$  and  $V_{\mathrm{o}}s$ , while the ones with low binding energy (LBE) can be assigned to the coordinated  $\mathrm{O}^{*}$  atoms bounded to "Sn" atoms. The area ratios of HBE to LBE peaks are estimated to  $65.9\%$ ,  $31.1\%$ , and  $44.3\%$  for pristine,  $\mathrm{LiOH}$ , and

$\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films, respectively. This manifests that the  $\mathrm{LiOH}$  additive can greatly reduce the surface  $- \mathrm{OH}$  and  $V_{\mathrm{O}}$  species of the final  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  film. Although the aging treatment seems to slightly weaken this effect, the  $- \mathrm{OH}$  and  $V_{\mathrm{O}}$  species for the  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  film are still less than the pristine one. The  $- \mathrm{OH}$  and  $V_{\mathrm{O}}$  species that usually generate trap states near the valence band are demonstrated to slow down the carrier transport rate at  $\mathrm{SnO}_2/$  perovskite interface and amplify the nonradiative recombination of charge carriers. Meanwhile, it was recently discovered that the excess  $- \mathrm{OH}$  and  $V_{\mathrm{O}}$  species may increase the positive charge of Sn atoms and cause an enlarged  $\mathrm{Pb - I}$  bond length at  $\mathrm{SnO}_2/$  perovskite interface. This less stable chemical bonding can further induce the generation of iodine interstitials and accelerate the degradation of device performance. Therefore, the reduced surface  $- \mathrm{OH}$  and  $V_{\mathrm{O}}$  groups in  $\mathrm{LiOH}$  and  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films are expected to improve both the PCEs and stability of the corresponding PSCs. The Li 1s XPS spectra in Figure 2c manifest that the Li dopants cannot be detected from  $\mathrm{LiOH}$  and  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging

$\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films. This can be attributed to the too low Li doping content to reach the detection limit of the XPS test. To support this standpoint, we prepared a similar  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  film with an increased concentration of the  $\mathrm{LiOH}$  additive  $(2\mathrm{mg / mL})$ . As seen, the clear XPS peak at  $54.82\mathrm{eV}$  can be found, which agrees with the Li 1s XPS peaks as substitutional lithium  $(\mathrm{Li}_{\mathrm{Sn}})$  involved in  $\mathrm{Li}_{\mathrm{Sn} - \mathrm{O}}$  bonds reported earlier. Thus, we infer that the  $\mathrm{Li}^{+}$ cations in the  $\mathrm{LiOH}$  additive finally reside in the  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films.

Figure 2d- f shows atomic force microscope (AFM) images of the various  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films. One can see that both the  $\mathrm{LiOH}$  additive and aging treatment have negligible influence on the film morphology. All the films have a uniform surface, with root- mean- square (RMS) roughness values of 3.07, 2.79, and  $2.89\mathrm{nm}$  for pristine,  $\mathrm{LiOH}$ , and  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films, respectively. The results in Figure 1 manifest that the pristine,  $\mathrm{LiOH}$ , and  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystal solutions possess quite good dispersibility and uniform particle sizes, which could contribute to the uniform surface morphology of the obtained  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films. The surface coverage of these  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films was further evaluated by measuring the  $I - V$  curves of the electron- only devices with the configuration of  $\mathrm{ITO / SnO}_2 / \mathrm{Ag}$ , as illustrated in the inset of Figure S5. Although the  $\mathrm{LiOH}$  and  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films are verified to have better conductivity than the pristine one, they exhibit smaller vertical currents (Figure S5). These results indicate better surface

coverage with fewer parasitic leakage current paths for the LiOH and  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films.

Surficial electric properties of the  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films were studied by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) technologies. The KPFM images in Figure  $2\mathrm{g - i}$  reveal that the surface potential distributions are quite uniform for all of the samples. Meanwhile, the surface potential increases in turn for pristine,  $\mathrm{LiOH}$  and  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films, revealing the decreased work functions  $(W_{ES})$  for them in the same order.45 The UPS spectra in Figure  $2\mathrm{j}$  support the KPFM results. To be specific, the cutoff binding energy  $(E_{\mathrm{cutoff}})$  edges were fitted to be 16.62, 16.47, and  $16.42\mathrm{eV}$  for pristine,  $\mathrm{LiOH}$  and  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films, respectively, from which the work functions  $(W_{ES})$  could be calculated to 4.6, 4.75, and  $4.8\mathrm{eV}$  following the equation of  $W_{F} = 21.22\mathrm{eV} - E_{\mathrm{cutoff}}$  Meanwhile, the values of the Fermi level  $(E_{F})$  minus valence band maximum  $(E_{\mathrm{VBM}})$ $(E_{F} - E_{\mathrm{VBM}})$  values were derived to be 3.72, 3.62, and 3.64  $\mathrm{eV}$ , respectively. Thus, the conduction band minimum  $(E_{\mathrm{CBM}})$  values were estimated to be  $- 4.54$ ,  $- 4.55$ , and  $- 4.62\mathrm{eV}$  for pristine,  $\mathrm{LiOH}$ , and  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films, respectively. Their energy level diagrams are plotted in Figure  $2\mathrm{k}$ , wherein the energy levels of the wide- bandgap perovskite film are also included.46 One can see that both Eand  $E_{\mathrm{CBM}}$  shift down in turn for pristine,  $\mathrm{LiOH}$ , and  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films. The relatively lower  $E_{F}$  and  $E_{\mathrm{CBM}}$  of the  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  film are more conducive to electron extraction and transfer at the  $\mathrm{SnO}_2/$  perovskite interface in the final PSC.23

The influence of the  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  film on the properties of the atop perovskite film is further investigated. Herein, we focus on the perovskite  $\mathrm{Cs_{0.14}MA_{0.23}PAs_{66}(Br_{12}O_{12}O_{2})}$ , films with a wide bandgap of  $1.68\mathrm{eV}$ , in consideration of their great potential for perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell applications. The films were prepared by the antisolvent- assisted one- step spin- coating method, as adopted in our previous works and described in detail in the experimental section.46 Figure  $3\mathrm{a - c}$  gives the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images measured from the top surface of the perovskite films grown on pristine,  $\mathrm{LiOH}$ , and  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films, respectively. It is clear that the modification of the  $\mathrm{LiOH}$  additive and aging treatment of the  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystal solution have a negligible impact on the surface coverage of perovskite films as well as their thicknesses (Figure S6), while the grain sizes show slight increases for resulting perovskite films in the order of pristine,  $\mathrm{LiOH}$ , and  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging. The average grain sizes are evaluated to be about 704, 917, and  $1005\mathrm{nm}$  for perovskite films grown on  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films formed with pristine,  $\mathrm{LiOH}$ , and  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystal solutions, respectively. A perovskite film with larger- sized grains means fewer grain boundaries in it, which could endow a smaller density of nonradiative recombination sites in the resulting PSC.

On the other hand, we delaminated the perovskite films off the  $\mathrm{SnO}_2 / \mathrm{ITO}$  substrates and used SEM to characterize their flipped bottom surface. This allows us to quantitatively investigate the influences of the varied  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films on the geometric characteristics of the perovskite grain surface microstructures that were originally at the perovskite- ETL heterointerface.47,48 As seen from Figure 3d, the perovskite sample based on the pristine  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  film has an uneven bottom surface and is composed of closely packed grains with many grain- boundary grooves on most of them, which is also illustrated in the bottom panel of Figure 3d for visualization. Figure 3e manifests that the bottom surface of the perovskite film grown on the  $\mathrm{LiOH}$ $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  film becomes much smoother, largely due to the greatly reduced grain- boundary grooves on the grains. In addition, the  $\mathrm{PbI}_2$  impurity with a typical lamellar structure can be observed from the sample. By comparison, the perovskite film prepared with the  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  sample possesses not only a smooth bottom surface with much- inhibited grain- boundary grooves but also is free of  $\mathrm{PbI}_2$  species (Figure 3f), both of which are highly desired for achieving an efficient and stable PSC because of their beneficial effects on the structural integrity, charge extraction, and reliability of the buried perovskite/  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  interface.26,46,49

Crystal characteristics of the perovskite films were studied by X- ray diffraction (XRD). The clear XRD peaks at  $14.4^{\circ}$ ,  $20.3^{\circ}$ ,  $24.9^{\circ}$ ,  $28.8^{\circ}$ , and  $32.3^{\circ}$  in Figure  $3\mathrm{g}$  can be indexed to the (100), (110), (111), (200), and (210) planes of the tetragonal perovskite phase. Meanwhile, the (100) and (200) XRD peaks intensify in sequence for the pristine,  $\mathrm{LiOH}$ , and  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging perovskite films, revealing their enhanced crystallinity in the same order. The additional XRD peak at  $11.5^{\circ}$  can be identified for the  $\mathrm{LiOH}$  perovskite film, which is assigned to the  $\delta$ - phase perovskite, as reported previously.50 The UV- vis absorption spectra in Figure 3h reveal similar absorption features of all the perovskite films, with the bandgap being estimated to be about  $1.68\mathrm{eV}$  (Figure S7). Figure 3i shows the time- resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay spectra of the perovskite films deposited on pristine,  $\mathrm{LiOH}$ , and  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films. The average decay constants of pristine,  $\mathrm{LiOH}$ , and  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging perovskite films are fitted as 0.17, 0.12, and  $0.08\mu \mathrm{s}$ , respectively, revealing more efficient electron transfer from the perovskite film to the  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  layer in the order of pristine,  $\mathrm{LiOH}$ , and  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging.

All of the above results show that the growth dynamics of the perovskite film can be regulated by the  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  film. In particular, we can obtain the perovskite film with larger grains, a pure phase, higher crystallinity, and fewer grain- boundary grooves by the use of the  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  sample. This achievement is probably due to the reduced surface  $- \mathrm{OH}$  and  $V_{\mathrm{O}}$  species induced by the  $\mathrm{LiOH}$  additive and aging treatment. On the one hand, it has been demonstrated that the OH groups at the  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  surface tend to coordinate with  $\mathrm{Pb}^{2 + }$ , forming  $\mathrm{Pb - OH}$  bonds vigorously. Meanwhile, the  $- \mathrm{OH}$  groups are amphoteric, and they can act as a base toward perovskite, possessing the ability to attract electron- loss  $\mathrm{Pb}^{2 + }$  cations in the perovskite precursors. These reactions can make for large surface and grain boundary energies, as well as their difference.49 The decreased  $- \mathrm{OH}$  species can significantly weaken these reactions and reduce the out- of- plane deformation of grain boundary grooving, thus suppressing the formation of grain- boundary grooves. On the other hand, the reduced surface  $- \mathrm{OH}$  and  $V_{\mathrm{O}}$  species also help to slow down the nucleation of perovskite grains, which accounts for the larger- sized and higher- crystallinity perovskite grains. To support these statements, we covered a  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  thin layer onto pristine  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  by atomic layer deposition (ALD) and annealed the sample at  $200^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  for  $30\mathrm{min}$ . As is well- known, the ALD  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  usually possesses fewer  $- \mathrm{OH}$  and  $V_{\mathrm{O}}$  species, thus expecting to enable a perovskite film similar to the  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  sample. Indeed, the SEM and XRD results in Figure S8 confirm our speculation.

Further, wide- bandgap PSCs were fabricated with the as- obtained perovskite films deposited on pristine,  $\mathrm{LiOH}$ , and  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films. The statistical PCEs of 20 individual devices with the various perovskite films are listed in Figure 4a.

(b)  $J - V$  curves of the corresponding best-performing PSCs. (c) EQE spectra along with integrated photocurrent densities, (d) EIS results, (e) TPC curves, and (f) TPV curves.

As expected, the PCEs increase orderly for the PSCs based on pristine,  $\mathrm{LiOH}$ , and  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films, and the average PCEs are estimated to be  $(18.79\pm 0.40)\%$ ,  $(19.53\pm 0.38)\%$ , and  $(20.16\pm 0.36)\%$  for them, correspondingly. The statistical  $J_{\mathrm{sc}}$ , FF, and  $V_{\mathrm{oc}}$  results are given in Figure S9 and Table S1, which basically follow similar variation trends with the PCEs. Figure 4b gives the current density versus voltage  $(J - V)$  curves for the best- performing ones among the three types of PSCs studied above. The related basic performance parameters, including  $J_{\mathrm{sc}}$ ,  $V_{\mathrm{oc}}$ , FF, and PCE, are presented in Table 1. We can make sense that, in comparison with the PSCs with pristine

$\mathrm{SnO}_2$  film, the higher PCE of the one with the  $\mathrm{LiOH}$ $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  film mainly originates from its larger  $J_{\mathrm{sc}}$ . The PSC with  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  film yields not only the similarly higher  $J_{\mathrm{sc}}$  of 21.88  $\mathrm{mA / cm^2}$ , but also a particularly larger  $V_{\mathrm{oc}}$  of  $1.18\mathrm{eV}$ , coupled with a greater FF of  $81.82\%$ , all of which contribute to the largest PCE of  $21.22\%$ . Table S2 summarizes the performance parameters of the previously reported PSCs fabricated with the perovskite films with a similar bandgap of  $1.68\mathrm{eV}$ . It is obvious that the PCE enabled by the  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  film is comparable with those of the PSCs reported recently. Hence, the simple  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging strategy could not only overcome the drawbacks of commercial  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  nanocrystal solutions but also enable efficient PSCs, making it promising for practical applications.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra in Figure 4c indicate a similar response wavelength region from 380 to 740 nm for all the typical PSCs based on pristine,  $\mathrm{LiOH}$ , and  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films, which is in line with the absorption features of the perovskite films. The  $J_{\mathrm{sc}}$  values integrated from the EQE spectra are about  $19.78\mathrm{mA / cm^2}$ ,  $20.17\mathrm{mA / cm^2}$ , and  $20.73\mathrm{mA / cm^2}$ , wherein slight discrepancies from those derived from the  $J - V$  curves maybe caused by the spectral inconsistency and the absence of bias light during the EQE tests. The carrier dynamics of the PSCs based on different  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films are also investigated by the use of electrochemical impedance (EIS) and transient photocurrent/photovoltage (TPC/TPV) technologies. The Nyquist plots that were recorded at a forward bias voltage of  $1.0\mathrm{V}$  and dark conditions are given in Figure 4d. The clear arc is related to carrier recombination, characterized by the recombination resistance  $R_{\mathrm{rec}}$ . We can see that the  $R_{\mathrm{rec}}$  enlarges in sequence for the PSCs built with pristine,  $\mathrm{LiOH}$ , and  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films, disclosing the suppressed nonradiative recombination of charge carriers in the same order. The corresponding TPC curves, which reflect the extraction and transport properties of charge carriers, are given in Figure 4e, while the TPV curves that suggest the recombination features of charge carriers are provided in Figure 4f. The TPC decay constants  $(\tau_{\mathrm{ave}})$  are fitted to 2.2, 1.9, and  $1.7\mu \mathrm{s}$  for PSCs based on pristine,  $\mathrm{LiOH}$ , and  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films, while the corresponding TPV decay constants  $(\tau_{\mathrm{ave}})$  are determined to be 0.059, 0.127, and  $0.298\mathrm{ms}$ , respectively. In general, faster TPC means more efficient extraction and transport of charge carriers, and the slower TPV stands for the weaker nonradiative recombination of them. So, we can deduce that the improved PCEs of PSCs in the order of pristine,  $\mathrm{LiOH}$ , and  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  films are primarily ascribed to the enhanced extraction and transport as well as the suppressed nonradiative recombination of charge carriers in the same order. Originally, these desired characteristics are mostly based on the  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  film with a broad absorption range, fewer defects, better transporting properties, and a smaller work function, coupled with the perovskite film with larger- sized grains, a pure phase, higher crystallinity, and fewer grain- boundary grooves.

In addition, the stability characteristics of the typical widebandgap PSC fabricated with  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO}_2$  film were investigated. The device was primarily encapsulated by a glass sheet assisted with UV- curable epoxy. Figure 5a gives the corresponding maximum power point tracking (MPPT) outputs measured under ambient conditions  $(20 - 35\%)$  relative humidity (RH),  $30 - 45^{\circ}C$  temperature) and with a simulated AM 1.5G illumination free of the UV cutoff. We can see that the PSC exhibits a relatively stable power output during the test period. Its PCE decreases from  $20.62\%$  to  $17.38\%$  after about  $1300\mathrm{h}$  of testing, retaining approximately  $84\%$  of the initial value. Meanwhile, a similar PSC was subjected to the accumulated  $\sim 72\mathrm{h}$  exposure on an  $85^{\circ}C$  hot plate inside an  $\mathrm{N}_2$  filled glovebox, coupled with 12 cycles of thermocycling test. The results in Figure 5b manifest that the PCE of the device decays from  $20.98\%$  to  $19.75\%$ , maintaining  $94\%$  of the initial value after the whole test. These stability features are

comparable with the PSCs based on advanced  $\mathrm{SnO_2}$  films reported earlier, thus they corroborate the remarkable ability of the PSC based on  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO_2}$  film to withstand moisture, light, and heat stresses.

# 3. CONCLUSIONS

We demonstrate that the LiOH additive can inhibit the agglomeration of  $\mathrm{SnO_2}$  nanocrystals due to the enriched surficial  $\mathrm{OH^{- }}$  species, with reinforced repulsion among each other. Meanwhile, it is found that the LiOH additive makes the aging treatment on the nanocrystal solution beneficial, coupled with effective  $\mathrm{Li^{+}}$  doping into  $\mathrm{SnO_2}$  nanocrystals. Therefore, the simultaneous agglomeration inhibition and electrical property optimization are achieved successfully, enabling the  $\mathrm{SnO_2}$  ETLs with a broadened absorption range, decreased work function, reduced defects, and improved transporting properties. Furthermore, the wide- bandgap perovskite  $\mathrm{Cs_{0.15}FA_{0.65}MA_{0.20}Pb(I_{0.80}Br_{0.20})_3}$  films grown on these desired  $\mathrm{SnO_2}$  ETLs are endowed with the characteristics of pure phase, higher crystallinity, fewer defects, better buried- interface contact, and more aligned energy levels with each other than the ones deposited on pristine  $\mathrm{SnO_2}$  ETLs. These desired features make for better extraction and transport as well as weaker nonradiative recombination of charge carriers in the PSCs. Thus, much higher average PCEs of  $(20.16\pm 0.36)\%$  along with a maximum value of  $21.12\%$  are achieved for the resulting wide- bandgap PSCs. In addition, superior stability under moisture, light, and heat stresses is also found for the typical device. Our work suggests a facile and effective strategy to modify commercial  $\mathrm{SnO_2}$  nanocrystal solutions for efficient and stable PSCs.

Preparation of various precursors. Pristine  $\mathrm{SnO_2}$  nanocrystal solution was obtained by diluting the commercial  $\mathrm{SnO_2}$  nanocrystal colloids (  $15\%$  in  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  colloidal dispersion) with deionized water (1:4 by volume). After the LiOH additive with an optimized concentration of  $2\mathrm{mg / mL}$  (Figure S10) was added to the fresh pristine  $\mathrm{SnO_2}$  nanocrystal solution and continuously stirred for  $1\mathrm{h}$ , the LiOH  $\mathrm{SnO_2}$  nanocrystal solution was achieved. And, when the LiOH  $\mathrm{SnO_2}$  nanocrystal solution was left to stand at  $26^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  in a dark condition for 30 days, the  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO_2}$  nanocrystal solution was prepared successfully. Perovskite  $\mathrm{Cs_{0.15}MA_{0.20}FA_{0.65}(Br_{0.20}I_{0.80})_3}$  precursor solution was prepared by adding  $1.040\mathrm{M}$ $\mathrm{PbI}_2$ ,  $0.057\mathrm{M}$  FAI,  $0.260\mathrm{M}$ $\mathrm{PbBr}_2$ ,  $0.260\mathrm{M}$  MABr, and  $0.195\mathrm{M}$  CsI into the mixed DMF and NMP solvent with a volume ratio of 4:1. BABr solution was obtained by adding  $1\mathrm{mg / mL}$  BABr into IPA. The Spiro- OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving  $72.5\mathrm{mg}$  of Spiro- OMeTAD in  $1\mathrm{mL}$  chlorobenzene with the additives of  $16.3\mu \mathrm{L}$  of Li- TFSI/ acetonitrile solution  $(520~\mathrm{mg / mL})$ ,  $28.5\mu \mathrm{L}$  of tBP, and  $15.1\mu \mathrm{L}$  of FK209 Co(III) TFSI/acetonitrile solution  $(375~\mathrm{mg / mL})$ .

Fabrication of wide- bandgap PSCs. First, a  $2\times 2.5\mathrm{cm}^2$  ITO glass substrate was ultrasonically cleaned in Decon90, deionized water, and anhydrous ethanol for  $20\mathrm{min}$ , followed by nitrogen blowing and ultraviolet ozone treatment for  $30~\mathrm{min}$ . Then, the pristine,  $\mathrm{LiOH}$ , or  $\mathrm{LiOH + }$  aging  $\mathrm{SnO_2}$  nanocrystal solution was spin- coated onto the precleaned ITO substrates at  $3000~\mathrm{rpm}$  for  $30~\mathrm{s}$ , with further thermal treatment at  $180^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  for  $15\mathrm{min}$ . Thus, various  $\mathrm{SnO_2}$  samples can be obtained. Then, these  $\mathrm{SnO_2}$  samples were directly transferred into a nitrogen- filled glovebox to produce perovskite films on them. To be specific,  $80\mu \mathrm{L}$  of perovskite  $\mathrm{Cs_{0.15}MA_{0.20}FA_{0.65}(Br_{0.20}I_{0.80})_3}$  precursor solution was spin- coated onto a  $\mathrm{SnO_2}$  film at  $1000~\mathrm{rpm}$  for  $5\mathrm{s}$  and  $4000~\mathrm{rpm}$  for  $45\mathrm{s}$ . During the first  $12\mathrm{s}$  of the whole spin- coating process,  $200\mu \mathrm{L}$  of chlorobenzene, acting as the antisolvent to DMF and NMP, was dropped onto the sample. After the above spin- coating process,  $50\mu \mathrm{L}$  of BABr solution was further spin- coated onto the sample at  $1000~\mathrm{rpm}$  for  $5\mathrm{s}$  and  $4000~\mathrm{rpm}$  for  $20\mathrm{s}$ , which was further followed by thermal annealing at  $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  to obtain the crystallized perovskite film. After that,  $80\mu \mathrm{L}$  of spiro- OMeTAD solution was spin- coated with the as- obtained  $\mathrm{Cs_{0.15}MA_{0.20}FA_{0.65}(Br_{0.20}I_{0.80})_3}$  film at  $1000~\mathrm{rpm}$  for  $5\mathrm{s}$  and  $4000~\mathrm{rpm}$  for  $40\mathrm{s}$  to form the HTL layer. Finally, a  $100\mathrm{nm}$  silver film was thermally evaporated onto the HTL to obtain a PSC.

Characterizations. DLS measurements were carried out with a Malvern (Zetasizer Nano ZS) light- scattering apparatus. Raman spectroscopy was performed on a high- resolution LabRAM HR800 spectrometer from Horiba at an excitation wavelength of  $633~\mathrm{nm}$ . XRD patterns were obtained with a Bruker D8 Advance X- ray diffractometer with a Cu Ka X- ray source  $(\lambda = 0.15418\mathrm{nm})$  at  $40\mathrm{kV}$  and  $40~\mathrm{mA}$ . SEM images were obtained by using a Helios NanoLab C3 scanning electron microscope. AFM/KPVM images were obtained using a V- Dimension Icon AFM system (Bruker, Santa Barbara, CA). HR- TEM tests were carried out by utilizing a JEM- F200 (JEOL Ltd.). instrument at an accelerating voltage of up to  $200\mathrm{kV}$ . XPS/UPS measurements were performed with a Thermo ESCALAB 250 XI using monochromated Al  $\mathrm{K}_a$  X- ray source  $(h\nu = 1486.6\mathrm{eV})$  and He- I photon source  $(21.21\mathrm{eV})$ , respectively. The base chamber pressure was kept in the  $10^{- 7}$  Pa range at room temperature. Absorption spectra of the samples were recorded by a UV- visible spectrophotometer (U- 4100, Hitachi). A step profiler (Bruker, Dektak XT) was used to examine the film thickness. Dark  $J - V$  curves were measured by a Keithley 2636B source meter unit in a shielding box. Light  $J - V$  curves were recorded using a Keithley 2450 source meter unit under AM 1.5 G illumination simulated by the XES- 70 S1 solar simulator. A shadow mask with an area of  $0.09\mathrm{cm}^2$  was adopted during the tests. Steady- state PL/TRPL was measured using a FluoTime 300 spectrometer (PicoQuant, Germany). EQE spectra were acquired by using a monochromator (Cornerstone: 74004) equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp (Oriel). EIS was performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660 B) in the dark. A forward bias of  $1\mathrm{V}$  was

applied to the devices during the EIS measurements. TPC/TPV curves were recorded by using a digital oscilloscope (Tektronix, D4105) on a self- built system with a modulated  $532~\mathrm{nm}$  pulse laser for excitation. The MPP test was performed upon encapsulation by a glass sheet with the assistance of UV- curable epoxy. During the test, the device was placed in ambient conditions  $(20 - 35\%)$  relative humidity (RH),  $30 - 45^{\circ}C$  temperature) and illuminated with a simulated AM  $1.5\mathrm{G}$  light source free of the UV cutoff. In terms of the thermocycling test, it was carried out on the device encapsulated by a glass sheet and UV- curable epoxy, which was placed onto an  $85^{\circ}C$  hot plate inside an  $\mathbb{N}_2$  - filled glovebox with continuous heating. To evaluate the PCE, the device was cooled to  $\sim 20^{\circ}C$  rapidly and was taken out of the glovebox to fulfill the test within  $3\mathrm{min}$  After that, the device was put back inside the  $\mathbb{N}_2$  - filled glovebox and baked at  $85^{\circ}C$  for the next- cycle test. The PCE tests were performed at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and  $72\mathrm{h}_{i}$  respectively.
